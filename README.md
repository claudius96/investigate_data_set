## Investigate dataset project
## Introduction 

TMDB Movies dataset contains about 10 000 movies collected from the TMDB dataset. It has 21 columns and about 10 800 entries. 

-  Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.


## Question(s) for Analysis

1. 20 most popular movies

2. which actor appeared in many movies

3. Is there a correlation between budget and revenue 
4. Which movie genre generated the most revenue

## conclusion
The TMDB movie data was quiet clean that there wasn't much effort need to work on it. They were null values which  i had to remove for my analysis know that they werent going to affect my analysis too much. 

I had to work more the two columns genres and cast which had a pipe after every genre or cast. I had to seperate the cast so that I can be able to answer my question which is which actor appeared in my movies along the course.

From this data I was able to find which actor featured in a lot of movies, I was able to find if there is a correlation between the movie budget and its return. I noticed that there was no correlation. I also used this data to find which was the most popular movie and if popularity was equated with the revenue the movie was earning but I found that there was no correlation between these two.

# Limitations
The challenges I faced working with this data was It was difficult to know the meaning of each columns. For example the column popularity what was the values there meaning. Did they mean the popularity of the movies for a day accumulated to a year or they meant something. 

Had the data included a file that explains the meaning of each column it would have been helpful.
